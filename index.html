        <p>
            I am a student at Brigham Young University studying computer science. I've also completed coursework in 
            finance, accounting, and business management. I will graduate in April 2019. <br /><br />
            My greatest passion is music. Music has been a part of my life since I was 5, when I started with classical 
            piano. As a teenager, I moved to composing film score and taking lessons during the summer at a recording 
            studio. I was accepted to BYU's Commercial Music program, but I dropped it after my mission because I wasn't
            getting the kind of musical education that I wanted. I now play piano and synthesizer for Suit Up, Soldier, 
            a rock band in Provo that I joined in March 2017. <br /><br />
            After I dropped the music program, I studied finance. I worked at Utah Community Credit Union as a loan officer
            for over a year, and I interned at Zion's Bank summer of 2017 in their small business banking group. I didn't 
            like the sales aspect or the culture of most finance jobs, so I switched to computer science two months ago.
            Following are reasons I switched to computer science:<br />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>More creative job roles</li>
            <li>Better job market</li>
            <li>Skills that are applicable to my own personal projects</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You can sample some of my creative projects and see more details on my work experience using the menu on the
